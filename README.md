# todolist

Description : Build a http server to support a todolist web app UI/UX.

---

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environment.

## Run the server locally

\$ node index.js

## Routes

More Details: Todolist.postman_collection.json

## Outcome self-assessment:

- Strayed way from http api and use express framework as a bad habit.
- Did not apply async/await practice from the beginning causing downtime while debugging.
- Overall: the outcome does not perform well as planned.

## What areas need improvement:

- PostgreSQL syntax
- DevOps: Choose the technologies that are compatible, and deliver the best product.
